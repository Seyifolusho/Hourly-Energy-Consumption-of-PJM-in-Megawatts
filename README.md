# PJM Hourly Energy Consumption Analysis: 

## **Introduction**  
As someone deeply interested in energy management, I undertook this project to analyze 10 years of hourly energy consumption data from PJM, a leading regional transmission organization. The goal was to uncover demand patterns, understand long-term trends, and provide actionable recommendations for improving grid management and energy efficiency. Through this work, I aim to contribute to more informed decision-making in grid operations and energy policy.

## **Problem Statement**  
Energy providers face significant challenges in maintaining a balance between supply and demand due to fluctuating consumption patterns. This project addresses key questions to better understand these fluctuations:  
- **Temporal Trends:** How does energy consumption vary across hours, days, months, and years?  
- **Peak Demand:** What times experience the highest energy usage, and what factors drive this demand?  
- **Seasonal Patterns:** Are there consistent seasonal variations in energy consumption?  
- **Long-term Trends:** What can we learn from 10 years of data to better plan for future energy needs?  

By addressing these questions, this analysis seeks to aid in optimizing grid operations and informing energy policies.

## **Dataset Description**  
The dataset used in this project contains 10 years of hourly energy consumption data from PJM. Its main features include:  
- **Datetime:** The timestamp for each observation.  
- **AEP_MW:** The energy consumption recorded in megawatts (MW).  

This high-frequency dataset is ideal for detailed temporal analysis and provides a solid foundation for uncovering insights into consumption patterns.

## **Analysis Steps**  

### **1. Data Loading and Preprocessing**  
I began by preparing the dataset to ensure it was clean and ready for analysis. Key steps included:  
- Loading the dataset using pandas.  
- Converting the "Datetime" column into a proper datetime object for easier manipulation.  
- Handling missing values by filling, interpolating, or dropping them as needed.  

### **2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
The next step was to gain an initial understanding of the dataset through:  
- Calculating summary statistics for energy consumption.  
- Visualizing overall trends using line plots.  
- Identifying anomalies or outliers that could affect the analysis.  

### **3. Temporal Analysis**  
To uncover variations in energy consumption across time, I:  
- Resampled the data to explore daily, monthly, and yearly aggregates.  
- Plotted energy consumption trends across these timeframes.  
- Highlighted periods of particularly high or low consumption.  

### **4. Seasonal Decomposition**  
Understanding seasonal variations was crucial, so I:  
- Decomposed the time series into trend, seasonality, and residual components using statistical methods such as STL (Seasonal and Trend decomposition using Loess).  
- Analyzed the contribution of each component to overall energy usage.  

### **5. Peak Demand Analysis**  
To address peak usage, I:  
- Identified the highest consumption periods and their corresponding times.  
- Analyzed how these periods correlated with external factors like seasonality or time of day.  

### **6. Visualization**  
To effectively communicate my findings, I:  
- Created line plots, heatmaps, and bar charts to illustrate trends and patterns.  
- Used comparative visualizations to highlight differences across hours, days, months, and years.

## **Insights**  

### **Key Findings**  
- **Daily Patterns:** Energy consumption consistently peaks during specific hours of the day, particularly mornings and evenings, which align with periods of high activity.  
- **Seasonal Variations:** Higher energy usage occurs in summer and winter months due to cooling and heating demands, respectively.  
- **Yearly Trends:** Over the 10-year span, there is a gradual increase in overall energy consumption, likely reflecting population growth and greater reliance on electricity.  
- **Peak Demand:** Peak consumption often coincides with extreme weather conditions, underscoring the importance of robust infrastructure to handle these surges.  

### **Anomalies**  
- Outliers in the data likely represent grid disruptions, unusual weather events, or data recording errors.

## **Recommendations**  

Based on the analysis, I propose the following strategies:  

### **Demand-Side Management**  
- Introduce demand response programs to encourage consumers to shift energy use to off-peak hours.  
- Promote the adoption of energy-efficient appliances to reduce overall consumption.  

### **Peak Demand Preparation**  
- Strengthen grid infrastructure to handle peak loads, particularly during extreme weather events.  
- Improve forecasting models to better predict periods of high demand and prepare accordingly.  

### **Seasonal Adjustments**  
- Plan for increased grid capacity during summer and winter months.  
- Launch seasonal energy-saving campaigns, focusing on reducing cooling and heating usage.  

### **Data Quality**  
- Establish continuous monitoring and validation processes to minimize data errors and anomalies.  
- Enrich future analyses by incorporating external factors like weather data and socioeconomic variables.

## **Conclusion**  
This project provided me with a deeper understanding of energy consumption patterns over the past decade. The insights gained can help energy providers optimize grid operations, enhance energy efficiency, and prepare for future demand.  

In the future, I aim to build on this work by developing predictive models and integrating additional datasets, such as weather and demographic data, to further refine recommendations and enable proactive energy management.
